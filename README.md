Age Claculator

ðŸš€ Exciting Project Update! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed a fun and useful Age Calculator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰

This project allowed me to explore and sharpen my skills in front-end development, and Iâ€™m excited to see how such simple tools can make a big impact in everyday life. The calculator takes in a user's birthdate and gives their precise age in years, months, and days.

âœ¨ Tech stack:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for functionality

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Simple, intuitive UI

Accurate age calculation

Responsive design

This project is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to build more tools and dive deeper into web development.
